## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge helped me deepen my understanding of building accessible and responsive UI components.

I learned how to:
- Structure HTML using the BEM methodology for better readability and scalability.
- Replace non-semantic elements with `<button>` to make the accordion keyboard-accessible.
- Use `aria-expanded` to communicate open and closed states to assistive technologies.
- Implement smooth transitions with `max-height` and opacity to improve the user experience.
- Center elements both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.
- Combine media queries and flexible units to achieve a mobile-first, responsive layout.
